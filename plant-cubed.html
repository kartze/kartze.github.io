        <h3>How might we promote sustainability education for the next generation?</h3>
        <p>To tackle the above question, Keith Corso and I designed and "founded" Plant³ (Plant-Cubed), a kit with a hydroponics cube and accompanying educational app for children to grow edible plants and learn about their impact on the
          environment. This was our major project for Northeastern University’s new <i>Semester in Silicon Valley</i> program in SF. For an intensive two months, we explored design thinking through a combined curriculum of Experience Design 1 and
          the Entrepreneurship capstone. As designer and “CEO”, I took lead on the design discussion and kept our team of two on schedule.</p>

        <h3>Context and Research</h3>
        <p>Keith had an early idea of a hydroponic cube curriculum or kit, which intrigued me. A <i>curriculum</i> involved designing an educational strategy, and a <i>kit</i> involved designing a system of components.</p>

        </a>
        <br><br>
        <p>To understand context, we took a step back from the product idea and created a landscape map of education and agriculture.</p>

          <img src="plant-cubed/stakeholders-map.jpeg" class="img-fluid lightbox-img" alt="stakeholders map for Plant-Cubed">
        </a>
        <br><br>
        <p>We also conducted research on the current space of sustainability education through interviews and surveys with users/stakeholders/experts. The research enabled us to identify a key challenge: How might we promote sustainable farming
          education and awareness in younger generations?</p>

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p id="placeholder">DIAGRAM / SKETCH OF PRODUCT SHOWING WHAT IS IN THE KIT, REPLACE NEXT PARAGRAPH.</p>
        <p>Leveraging experiential learning, we decided to create a hydroponics curriculum/kit. The kit would feature a hydroponics cube, and an app would accompany the kit (connected to the cube by Bluetooth) and act as an active guide for the
          user. Through our process we arrived at the name “Plant³”, or “Plant-Cubed”, to reflect the shape of the kit and concept of growth (personal and literal). </p>
        <p id="placeholder">PHOTO OF MACRO AND MICRO EXPERIENCE SKETCHES, REPLACE NEXT PARAGRAPH.</p>
        <p>In the macro experience, we envisioned children at home opening the kit, getting excited about growing their own plants, going so far as to even making simple recipes with the plants, sharing their progress with other kids in the ’hood,
          monitoring their impact on the environment, and as adults, practicing sustainable and nutritional habits. In the micro experience, we focused on the touchpoint in which a child checks his dashboard 3 weeks after planting, showing his
          arugula's growth and his impact on the environment.</p>
        <p>We designed user flows between the cube and app and wrote instructions and other interface copy. Because this kit was aimed towards children, materials would have to be suitably understandable.</p>
        <p id="placeholder">IMAGES OF CUBE. WIREFRAMES. APP PROTOTYPE.</p>
        <p>We bought supplies from an art store to construct our hydroponic cube and Keith picked some demonstrative plants on his morning walk. Keith was in charge of prototyping the physical cube and I was in charge of prototyping the
          accompanying app using Adobe XD. We mocked photos of the cube being used over weeks to grow __.</p>

        <h3>Final Pitch</h3>
        <p id="placeholder">FIND PHOTOS</p>
        <p>We presented Plant³ to investors on our final day of the program. It was Shark Tank style, and while we mainly focused on business for our pitch, we included details behind the design of our product. The final pitch was wild — the
          investors asked us hard questions regarding our business plan and gave us absolutely no slack for being students! They picked our business apart completely but I was so much happier for the challenging and thrilling experience.</p>

        <h3>Takeaways </h3>
        <p>This was all new to me. While I was occasionally lost in the fast-paced duo-curriculum (research statements may be phrased differently in design and entrepreneurship!), I was driven by the exciting challenge of taking this project from
          open brainstorming to tangible prototypes, complete with a business plan. </p>
        <p>I learned design thinking methodologies, from broad ecosystem mapping to envisioning both macro and micro experiences. SO MANY POST-IT NOTES! My favourite part was strategizing the content of our product and seeing how
          everything — research, branding, mission — came together like a puzzle. </p>
        <p>Keith and I also had a team dynamic that offered challenges as well as many opportunities to learn from each other. We came from different backgrounds — Keith was heavily engaged with the business school, was the Entrepreneurs Club
          president, and was also actively working on his own side venture as CEO. As students of the program, we were required to both be designers and to both be involved in the business planning. While I led the design and he led the business
          planning, we kept each other on track throughout the process. </p>
        <p>From Keith and the program itself, I learned more about entrepreneurship. Honestly, when I entered the program, I felt a bit of Impostor Syndrome. The prerequisites were waived for me, and with Keith and the other 3 in my class at
          least 2 grade levels older, I felt the least qualified to be taking the Entrepreneurship capstone! However, as I got dressed up for the final pitch, rather than feeling like an impostor, I realized that I had taken on the challenge and
          done
          well.</p>
        <p id="placeholder">TEAM/GROUP PHOTO?</p>
        <p>Going forward, because of this project, I plan to pursue experience design as my degree concentration.</p>
